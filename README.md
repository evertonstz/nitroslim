nitroslim 0.9
=========

### Changelog ###
0.9 - code migrated to python 3. It's not fully implemented yet, some new features are brightness (soon to be auto set) and contrast. Random mode not fully implemented yet in this version.
0.7 - now you can set random wallpapers. Try to cron it!

### What this contraption does? ###
Basically Nitroslin is a piece of code to "sync" your Nitrogen wallpaper with Slim/Slimlock wallpaper, giving it a fake transparent apearance. You can set blur, brightness and even contrast to the new image.

### What Slim theme did I use in the screenshot? ###
pacman -S archlinux-themes-slim

### How it works? ###
